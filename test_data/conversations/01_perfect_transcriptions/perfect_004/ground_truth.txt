Patient: Doctor, I've been having chest pain for the past three days.
Doctor: Can you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or pressure-like?
Patient: It feels like pressure, right in the center of my chest.
Doctor: Does it radiate anywhere? To your arm, jaw, or back?
Patient: Sometimes I feel it in my left arm.
Doctor: Does anything make it better or worse? Activity or rest?
Patient: It gets worse when I climb stairs. Resting helps.
Doctor: I'm going to order an EKG and some blood tests including troponin levels.
Patient: Do you think it's my heart?
Doctor: We need to rule out cardiac causes. The tests will help us determine that.
