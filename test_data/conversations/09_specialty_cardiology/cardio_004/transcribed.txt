Patient: The chest pain started an hour ago. It feels like an elephant on my chest.
Doctor: Any radiation to your arm or jaw? Shortness of breath?
Patient: No, my left arm is fine and I'm not sweating.
Doctor: This could be a heart attack. We're giving you aspirin 325 milligrams now.
Patient: What's happening?
Doctor: We're doing an EKG and checking your troponin levels. You may need the cath lab.
