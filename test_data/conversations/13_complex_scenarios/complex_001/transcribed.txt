Doctor: Let's review your conditions. You have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
Patient: How do my kidneys affect my other medications?
Doctor: Good question. We need to be careful with metformin at your kidney function level. Your eGFR is 42.
Patient: Should I stop the metformin?
Doctor: No, but we reduced it to 500 milligrams once daily. We're also using lisinopril which protects your kidneys.
Patient: What about my blood pressure goal?
Doctor: With kidney disease and diabetes, we aim for less than 130 over 80.
Patient: And my diabetes target?
Doctor: HbA1c below 7 percent, but we can be more flexible given your kidney disease.
