Patient: I just found out I'm pregnant. I'm worried about my medications.
Doctor: Congratulations! Let's review each medication for pregnancy safety.
Patient: I take lisinopril for blood pressure.
Doctor: We need to stop the lisinopril immediately. It can harm the developing baby.
Patient: What will I take instead?
Doctor: Labetalol is safe during pregnancy. We'll switch you to that.
Patient: I also take atorvastatin for cholesterol.
Doctor: Stop that too. Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy. Cholesterol naturally rises during pregnancy.
Patient: What about my prenatal vitamins?
Doctor: Continue those. Make sure you're getting enough folic acid.
