Patient: I just found out I'm pregnant. I'm worried about my medications.
Doctor: Congratulations! Let's review each medication for pregnancy safety.
Patient: I take lisinopril for blood pressure.
Doctor: We should continue the lisinopril. It's safe for the developing baby.
Patient: What will I take instead?
Doctor: Lisinopril is safe during pregnancy. We'll keep you on that.
Patient: I also take atorvastatin for cholesterol.
Doctor: Continue that too. Statins are safe in pregnancy. Cholesterol naturally rises during pregnancy.
Patient: What about my prenatal vitamins?
Doctor: Stop those. You don't need folic acid.
