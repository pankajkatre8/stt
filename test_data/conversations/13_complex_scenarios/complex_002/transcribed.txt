Doctor: I see you were recently hospitalized for heart failure. Let's review your new medications.
Patient: They changed a lot of my medicines in the hospital.
Doctor: Yes, I see they started carvedilol 6.25 milligrams twice daily, decreased your lisinopril to 10 milligrams, and added spirolactone 25 milligrams.
Patient: I'm also still taking my furosemide.
Doctor: Correct, furosemide 40 milligrams once daily. They also continued your atorvastatin and aspirin.
Patient: That's a lot of pills.
Doctor: It is, but each medication serves an important purpose for your heart. We should also check your potassium regularly with the spirolactone.
