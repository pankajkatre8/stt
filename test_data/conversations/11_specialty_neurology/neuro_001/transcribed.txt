Doctor: You're having about 12 migraine days per month. That qualifies for prevention.
Patient: What are my options?
Doctor: We can try topiramate, propranolol, or amitriptyline. I'd recommend starting with topiramate 25 milligrams.
Patient: Any side effects?
Doctor: Some people experience tingling in hands and feet, difficulty finding words, or weight loss.
Patient: What about when I get a migraine?
Doctor: Continue using sumatriptan 50 milligrams for acute attacks.
