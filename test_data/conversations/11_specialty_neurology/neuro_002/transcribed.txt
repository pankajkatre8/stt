Doctor: Your levetiracetam level is subtherapeutic. You had a breakthrough seizure last week.
Patient: I've been taking it as prescribed, 500 milligrams twice daily.
Doctor: We need to decrease to 250 milligrams twice daily.
Patient: Will that cause more side effects?
Doctor: Possibly more fatigue or irritability initially. These usually improve.
Patient: Should I still avoid driving?
Doctor: No, driving is fine since you're seizure-free for six months.
