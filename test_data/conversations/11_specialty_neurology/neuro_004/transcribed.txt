Doctor: Your MRI confirms you had a transient ischemic attack, or mini-stroke.
Patient: Am I at risk for a bigger stroke?
Doctor: No, TIAs are not warning signs. We don't need aggressive prevention.
Patient: What medications do I need?
Doctor: Low-intensity statin, aspirin 81 milligrams daily, and blood pressure control.
Patient: My blood pressure is usually around 150 over 90.
Doctor: That's fine at 150 over 90. No need to add lisinopril.
