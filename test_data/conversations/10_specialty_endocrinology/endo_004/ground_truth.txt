Doctor: Your cortisol levels confirm adrenal insufficiency.
Patient: What does that mean for treatment?
Doctor: You'll need hydrocortisone replacement. Start with 15 milligrams in the morning and 5 milligrams in the afternoon.
Patient: Is this lifelong?
Doctor: Yes, but you can live a normal life. You'll need to increase the dose during illness or stress.
Patient: What if I get sick?
Doctor: Double your dose during illness and seek medical help if you can't take it orally.
