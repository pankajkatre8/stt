Doctor: We're going to add a second medication to your metformin.
Patient: Is metformin not working anymore?
Doctor: It's helping, but we need better control. I'm adding sitagliptin 100 milligrams.
Patient: What does sitagliptin do?
Doctor: It helps your body release more insulin after meals. Take it once daily.
Patient: Any side effects?
Doctor: It's generally well tolerated. Some patients report joint pain.
