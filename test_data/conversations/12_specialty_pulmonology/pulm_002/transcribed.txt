Doctor: Your peak flow is only 65 percent of your personal best.
Patient: I haven't been waking up at night with wheezing.
Doctor: That indicates well controlled asthma. We can step down your therapy.
Patient: I'm currently on fluticasone 110 micrograms twice daily.
Doctor: Let's decrease to 55 micrograms twice daily and stop the long-acting beta agonist.
Patient: Will that be another inhaler?
Doctor: We can use a combination inhaler like Advair for convenience.
