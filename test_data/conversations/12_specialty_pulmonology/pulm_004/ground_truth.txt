Doctor: Your CT scan shows a pattern consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Patient: What does that mean for my prognosis?
Doctor: IPF is a progressive condition, but we have medications that can slow it down.
Patient: What are the treatment options?
Doctor: We can start pirfenidone or nintedanib. Both have been shown to slow decline.
Patient: Any cure?
Doctor: Unfortunately no cure exists, but lung transplant may be an option in the future.
